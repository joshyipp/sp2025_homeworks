    "The loss decreases more smoothly compared to the manual implementation. It follows a more gradual and consistent downward trend instead of a sharp drop. Around 150-200 iterations, the loss has a clear inflection point where it slows down before converging. Pytorch may use better weight initialization techniques, or have adaptive learning rates (maybe ADAM?). Maybe weight decay also plays a role.\n"
